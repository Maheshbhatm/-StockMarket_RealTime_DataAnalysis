<h3>Overview</h3>

The stock market has a lot of stocks and at the end of the day, the website will provide https://www.nseindia.com/market-data/ in CSV formate. 

The website is not provided with an EXPORT option as CSV or any other formate. 

The project is to demonstrate web scraping using SPARK and DataBricks in Azure. The small code will help us get the CSV data in Data Lake Storage.

<h3>Source Date Files</h3>
We are referring open-source data from website https://money.rediff.com/ 

<h3>Filtering</h3>
We can get the data based on the End of the Day, End of the week, and End of month percentage of changes. 
Also, we can sort according to NSE or BSE data.
